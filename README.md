Overview

Fluxion is a Python-based simulation project designed to model football-like events as a stochastic chaotic system. It generates event-level data for a match, including passes, shots, goals, turnovers, and possession, in a way that balances randomness with realistic constraints. This allows us to study the dynamics of chaotic systems in sports and potentially extend the methodology to other domains where chaos and unpredictability play a role.

Features

Dynamic Game Simulation: Simulates a football match with probabilistic events that adapt based on field position, previous events, and momentum.

Event Logging: Each event (pass, shot, goal, turnover) is tracked with detailed positional and temporal information.

Statistics & Scoreboard: Generates match statistics such as passes, shots, turnovers, goals, and possession time for each team.

Visualization: Provides step-by-step replay animations, event heatmaps, and a visual overview of match flow.

Data Export: Event-level data can be exported to CSV for further analysis or machine learning applications.

Optimized Data Generation: Ensures realistic yet stochastic outputs for model training and analysis of chaotic systems.

Goals

The main objectives of Fluxion are:

Understand Chaos in Sports Dynamics: Study how randomness and deterministic factors combine in complex systems like football matches.

Generate Optimized Training Data: Produce realistic datasets suitable for machine learning models to predict patterns or analyze chaotic behavior.

Bridge Simulation & Analytics: Allow visualizations, statistics, and analytics to be derived directly from simulated events.

Extendable Framework: Provide a general architecture that can be adapted to other domains involving stochastic or chaotic processes.

Why This Project?

Studying chaotic systems through sports provides a tangible, intuitive, and data-rich environment. By simulating matches in a controlled but probabilistic way, Fluxion helps us:

Generate large datasets without relying on scarce real-world data.

Analyze the effects of positional strategy, momentum, and probabilistic events.

Prepare realistic data for machine learning experiments on pattern recognition and prediction in chaotic systems.
